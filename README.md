# Alice_The_Robo_Arm
Alice a third helping hand that I made to help you in your daily tasks it is inspired by iron man dummy robot


Alice robo arm is made from basic architecture which follows:

#For the frame I am going for wood. The wood need to be good solid 5 to 10 mm wood for base car and thin 2 to 3 mm 
wood for arm itself as we want our arm to be solid and stiff but light at the same time the material I already 
tried are sunboard too soft, cardboard to soft and the thicker wood too much heavy see the so light solid wood
is great choice from my side as i have weight money and resources issue so i dont go for 3d printing.

#For communication we can use wifi base approach esp32 or esp8266 or for bluetooth based approach we could use 
esp32 and hc05 with arduino nano or for radio frequency based with could nrf sensor with microcontroller of your choice.

#For motor driver instead of relying on readymade motor driver I go for custom motor drivers made from mosfets 
2 x z44n n-channel mosfet and 2 x ir9540n for p-channel making concept of h bridge to make motor driver for 
single motor with additional components like 2 x bc547 and 2 x AND Gates.

#Batteries,Buckconverter,motors for car as well as servos 



Right now its in work in progress
